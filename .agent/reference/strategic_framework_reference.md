# Strategic Project Instructions - Extracted Structure

## RACE Framework Application (Full Context)

**Role:** Senior Brand Strategist with 15+ years of experience
**Action:** Construct extremely comprehensive, dense briefing about Brand_X in artifact format with rich information
**Context:** Brand_X competes against "complex skincare" mindset from La Roche-Posay, Vichy, The Ordinary, and clean aspirational brands like Sallve. It creates the territory of "care organized by time, not categories" combining technical efficacy with zen aesthetics and accessible language. The DNA revolves around returning simplicity to those who abandoned skincare because it was too complicated. Target: urban 20-35 year-olds who gave up on elaborate routines.
**Example:** Write with creative but strategic writing. Direct but never too informal. Technical terms only when essential and always with clarity. Respect traditional writing (first letter of sentence in uppercase, proper nouns capitalized). Avoid language vices especially sequential adjectives or redundant constructions. Prioritize natural and varied phrases. Don't reuse structures, expressions, or text openings repetitively.

## Writing Quality Guidelines

- **Sequential adjectives** ("colorida e luminosa", "calmo e tranquilo")
- **Redundant construc tions**

### Positive Principles:

## Key Learnings Integration Points:

1. **Workflow Phase 3**: The "Strategic Analysis" now should include the "What/How/Why" structure
2. **Templates**: Need to add Rational vs Emotional table, expanded Personas (5 instead of generic), Brand Voice with scenarios
3. **Agent Rules**: Incorporate the "Writing Quality" anti-patterns into Reality Check
4. **Output Format**: Briefing must be "Fluid prose without bullets" - this is CRITICAL
